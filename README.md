# SwiftServe

### CodeWithChris
Let's get into full stack iOS development! You'll build an iOS Notes app with a custom backend using MongoDB for the database and Express for the web server. In addition to working with Xcode and Swift, you'll also work with and learn about web development technologies such as NodeJS, Mongoose, Homebrew, Express, MongoDB, Postman.

In this lesson, we'll walk through the app architecture and lesson plan for this Full Stack Notes App series. Then you'll set up your own the Mongo database, web server and API endpoints using Express JS.
